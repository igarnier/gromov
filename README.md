# gromov
The Gromov library proposes combinators to build metric spaces from simpler ones.
Currently available operations are:
- various tensors of metric spaces
- transformation of the distance so that it becomes bounded
- metrisation of the disjoint union of two metric spaces
- Hausdorff distance over finite subsets of a metric space

TODO
- Kantorovich distance on finitely supported distributions
- distances on structured data: graphs, etc
