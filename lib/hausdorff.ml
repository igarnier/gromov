(* Various implementations of the Hausdorff distance between subsets of a metric
   space. Here, we only consider finite subsets. The implementations vary in the 
   data structure used to represents subsets: balanced trees, lists, arrays, etc. 
   Some data structures might require more hypothesis on the structure of the
   underlying space. *)
